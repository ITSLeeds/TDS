# Introduction

This document explores the impact of lockdowns on the rate of collisions.

# Data and methods

Datasets were taken from the STATS19 database and processed with the `stats19` R package [@lovelace2019].

# Results

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(stats19)
dl_stats19(year = 2020, type = "collision")
collisions_2020 = get_stats19(year = 2020, type = "collision")
```

See the results in @fig-crashes-per-day.

```{r}
#| label: fig-crashes-per-day
#| echo: false
collisions_per_day = collisions_2020 |> 
  group_by(date) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n()
  )
collisions_per_day |> 
  ggplot(aes(date, n)) +
  geom_line()
```
