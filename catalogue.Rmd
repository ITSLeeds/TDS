## Module summary

The quantity, diversity and availability of transport data is increasing rapidly, requiring skills in the management and interrogation of data and databases.
Recent years have seen a new wave of 'big data' and 'data science' changing the world, with the Harvard Business Review describing Data Science as the 'sexiest job of the 21st century' (see [hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)).
Transport researchers increasingly need to take data from a wide range of sources and perform non-standard analyses methods on them to inform the decision-making process.

Despite these developments the transport sector has been slow to adapt to new methods and workflows.
The Transport Systems Catapult, for example, identified a skills gap in "skilled technical talent capable of handling and analysing very large datasets compiled from multiple sources" (see [ts.catapult.org.uk](https://ts.catapult.org.uk/news-events-gallery/news/report-warns-of-uk-skills-shortage-in-im-sector/)).

This module takes a highly practical approach to learning about 'data science' tools and their application to investigating transport issues.
The focus is on practical data science, enabling attendees to make use of a wide range of datasets to answer real-world transport planning questions .

## Objectives

- Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic.
- Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data.
- Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets.
- Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
- Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
- Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
- Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio 

<!-- - Learn how to use these skills in the wider context of a dynamic team environment, including project set-up (e.g. deciding between cloud services and local computing power) and problem definition; team workflow; sourcing and interrogating data; applying statistical methods; visualising data and communicating the results (e.g. via the deployment of web services). -->

## Learning outcomes

Students will become confident at working in data science teams working on transport problems; in selecting appropriate tools to answer societal and business questions with a range of input data types; and understanding the wider implications of the increasing use of data science for transport planning. 

Specifically, learning outcomes will include the ability to:

- Identify available datasets and access and clean them
- Combine datasets from multiple sources
- Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
- Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
- Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
- Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods

## Syllabus 

- Software for practical data science
- The structure of transport data e.g. flows, incidents, origin/destination, GIS
- Data cleaning and subsetting 
- Accessing data from web sources
<!-- - Route assignment with remote routing services and locally installed software -->
- Processing data using remote services and locally installed software 
- Data visualization
- Machine learning
- Professional and ethical issues of big data in transport Transport data analysis

## Subject specific skills

Students will gain skills in:

- Importing a range of transport data file formats from the command-line
- Setting-up data science projects to ensure reproducibility
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Visualisation of large datasets
<!-- - Routing on road networks -->

## Private study

Students are expected to spend their study time on software set-up and worked examples, plus background reading for lectures, preparatory work for workshops and assessed coursework. Unsupervised teamwork practical sessions will be arranged to ensure a complete portfolio.

## Rationale for teaching and learning methods and relationship to learning outcomes 

There is a blend of lectures, seminars and practical sessions designed to fulfil the learning outcomes. 

A combination of lectures and seminars will be used to teach and gain understanding of the core skills and principles e.g. database design. This will be supported and augmented by independent learning. 

A key aim of the module is to gain hands-on experience designing, implementing and communicating data analysis workflows during supervised practical sessions, and consolidated in unsupervised practical sessions. 

## Monitoring of student progress

Progress will be monitored informally during supervised practical sessions.
 
Formative feedback will be given after interim informal assessment of their in-progress project portfolio (week 4/5)

## Methods of assessment

**Coursework**

<table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="17%">Assessment type</td><td valign="top" align="left" width="65%">Notes</td><td valign="top" align="right" width="18%">% of formal assessment</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="17%">Portfolio</td><td valign="top" align="left" width="65%">Project Portfolio</td><td valign="top" align="right" width="18%">100.00</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" align="left">Total percentage (Assessment Coursework)</td><td valign="top" align="right">100.00</td></tr></table>

<!-- 20% of the mark for the assessment of the portfolio will be determined as an initial assessment after week 5. Feedback will be provided. The remaining 80% will be awarded in respect of the final submitted portfolio. -->

### Other information about assessment

The project portfolio will be used as the basis for formative assessment mid-way through the semester.
This will highlight if any students are struggling.
If a portfolio fails the assessment criteria the student will have an opportunity to resubmit a report outlining what they have learned in the areas in which they are failing.


## Pre-requisites

You will be expected to have a laptop with recent versions of R and RStudio installed.
See instructions here for getting an up-to-date R installation: https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#installing-r

It is also recommended that you install GitHub Desktop (or command line git on Linux and Mac), Docker, Python, QGIS and transport modelling tools such as SUMO but these are not essential.

## Specific/online resources

- It's worth thinking about what you want to do next so I recommend taking a look for 'data science' and transport jobs on sites such as www.cwjobs.co.uk

- For a refresher on maths it may be useful to have a maths text book on hand. This should cover mathematical concepts including vectors, matrices, eigenvectors, numerical parameter optimization, calculus, dierential equations, Gaussian distributions, Bayes' rule, covariance matrices.
