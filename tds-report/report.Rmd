# Introduction

This is the intro.
I used RMarkdown.
To compile the document I used the following shortcut:

```
Ctrl+Shift+K
```

You can change this line

```
  html_document:
```

to

```
  pdf_document:
```

to get PDF output.
If you get an error no problem: you can save the html file as a PDF in Chrome.
You can try to get the PDF version working with the following commands.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_cran("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# This code is hidden in the output document

```
