```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# print pdf
pagedown::chrome_print("practicals/5-web.md")
pagedown::chrome_print("practicals/5-web.html")
browseURL("practicals/5-web.pdf")
piggyback::pb_upload("practicals/5-web.pdf")
piggyback::pb_download_url("practicals/5-web.pdf")
```

We will be using these packages in this practical:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(stats19)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Bonus Exercises - Some advanced R concepts

### If statements

If statements allow you to conditionally run code based on boolean logic.

A simple `if` statement looks like this

```{r example_if, eval=TRUE}
x = 10
if(x == 10) {
    message("if x equal to ten, this message is shown")
}
```

You can enhance `if` with `else`

```{r example_if_else, eval=TRUE}
x = 10
if(x %% 2 == 0) {
    message("x is even this message is shown")
} else {
    message("x is odd this message is shown")
}

```

You can add additional tests and outcomes with `else if`

```{r example_else_if, eval=TRUE}
x = 10
if(!is.numeric(x)) {
    message("If x is not a number then this message is shown")
} else if(x %% 2 == 0) {
    message("x is even this message is shown")
} else {
    message("x is odd this message is shown")
}

```

You can add as many `else if` statements as you like, but remember they are evaluated in order. So be careful with complex logical tests.

**Exercise**: Experiment with different values of `x` in the above if statements. Try large and small numbers, negative numbers, and non-numeric objects.

You can modify the logical tests in the `if` statement with boolean operators such as `&`, `&&`,`|`, `||`, `xor()`, and `!`, or comparisons like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<=`. 

**Exercise**: Experiment with different boolean operators and comparisons. Hint `?Logic`

### Functions

By now you are familiar with using R functions e.g. `sum()`. But you can also write your own functions in R.

```{r example_func, eval=TRUE}
myfunction = function(x){
  x = x ^ 2
  x
}
```

This function takes in an input value and squares it. Give it a go:

```{r example_func2, eval=FALSE}
myfunction(1:10)
```
You can pass multiple argument to a function

```{r example_func3, eval=TRUE}
myfunction2 = function(x, y){
  z = x * y
  z
}

myfunction2(x= 1:10, y = 2)
```
It is good practice to write functions when you have a task you need to do many times. You can replace many lines of code with a single function and avoid repeating code. 

### Loops

Loops are how you tell R to repeat something. They can be useful for iterating over a dataset.


```{r example_loop, eval=TRUE}
for(i in 1:5){
  x = i * 10
  message("'i' is ",i,", 10x 'i' is ",x)
}
```
While loops can be useful the can also be very slow if used wrongly. Lets use a more complex example. We will make a muliple ring buffer of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500m.

```{r make_point, eval=TRUE}
# Make a point in Leeds
pt = st_sfc(st_point(c(-1.556995, 53.808111)), crs = 4326)
# Make point into SF data frame
pt = st_sf(data.frame(id = 1, geometry = pt))
# Transfrom to British national grid
pt = st_transform(pt, 27700)

```

First a bad example

```{r loop_bad, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
buffers = st_buffer(pt, 100)

for(i in 2:5){
  dist = i * 100
  buff = st_buffer(pt, dist)
  buffers = rbind(buffers, buff)
}
plot(buffers$geometry)
```
This will work, but it is a bad example because each time you run `buffers = rbind(buffers, buff)` the `buffers` object is copied. Copying data slows down R and will make this function get exponentially slower as the number of iterations increases.

A good example

```{r loop_good, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
buffers = vector("list", 5)
for(i in 1:5){
  dist = i * 100
  buffers[[i]] = st_buffer(pt, dist)
}
buffers = dplyr::bind_rows(buffers)
plot(buffers$geometry)
```
Here we created and empty list of length 5 and added each buffer to the end of the list. This avoids the copying and so the process will be much faster.

Then we used the `bind_rows` function to combine the list of data.frames into a single data.frame.

**Bonus** R has even faster ways to iterate such as the `apply` and `purrr::map` families of functions. Read up about these functions


### The FizzBuzz Challange

Write a function to play the children's game of Fizz Buzz.

Rules of Fizz Buzz

- You count up from 1, saying each number but:
- If the Number is a multiple of 3 you say Fizz
- If the number is a multiple of 5 you say Buzz
- If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 you say Fizz Buzz

E.g. `1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz`

Write a function that can play Fizz Buzz for any number of rounds.
Compare the speed of your code with other students solutions using `bench::mark`.

```{r benchmark, eval=TRUE}
bench::mark(f1 = myfunction(1:10),
            f2 = myfunction2(1:10,1:10))
```

```{r fizbuzz, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}


fizzbuzz1 <- function(n){
  res = list()
  for(i in 1:n){
    if(i %% 3 == 0 & i %% 5 == 0){
      res[[i]] = "FizzBuzz"
    }
    if(i %% 3 == 0 & i %% 5 != 0){
      res[[i]] = "Fizz"
    }
    if(i %% 3 != 0 & i %% 5 == 0){
      res[[i]] = "Buzz"
    }
    if(i %% 3 != 0 & i %% 5 != 0){
      res[[i]] = as.character(i)
    }
  }
  unlist(res)
}

fizzbuzz2 <- function(n){
  purrr::map_chr(1:n,function(x){
    mod3 = (x %% 3) == 0
    mod5 = (x %% 5) == 0
    if(mod5){
      if(mod3){
        "FizzBuzz"
      } else{
        "Buzz"
      }
    } else if(mod3){
      "Fizz"
    } else{
      as.character(x)
    }
  })
}

bench::mark(f1 = fizzbuzz1(100),
            f2 = fizzbuzz2(100))
```

Think about how your code can be modified for different rules. For example, what if we used different multiples or their was more words?


## Accessing crowd-sourced data from OSM

- Navigate to https://overpass-turbo.eu/ and play with the interface to see what data is available from OpenStreetMap. Download data on highway=cycleway for Leeds from https://overpass-turbo.eu/

- Load the data in R and plot it with your favourite plotting package (e.g. `sf`, `mapview` or `tmap`)

- Bonus: now try to get the same data using the **osmdata** package


## Get travel to work data with the PCT

Use the `pct` package's inbuilt help to find out how to get data for West Yorkshire.
Hint: the code below gets zones for Leeds:

```{r getzones}
library(pct)
head(pct::pct_regions)
# see all regions with View(pct_regions)
zones = get_pct_zones(region = "west-yorkshire")
zones_leeds = zones %>% 
  filter(lad_name == "Leeds")
zones_leeds %>% 
  select(bicycle:taxi_other) %>% 
  plot()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?get_pct_routes_fast
```

Bonus (if you have time and a decent computer): download and import the 'car.zip' data from https://github.com/ITSLeeds/NTEM2OD/releases

## Getting data from the web

Read through Section [8.2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html#retrieving-data) and 8.3 of Geocomputation with R. 

Complete Exercises 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the chapter

## Bonus 1: osmextract

Take a read of the documentation for the [`osmextract`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract/index.html) package.

Reproduce the examples

Get all supermarkets in OSM for West Yorkshire

Identify all cycleways in West Yorkshire and, using the stats19 data you have already downloaded, identify all crashes that happened near them.

## Bonus 2: Getting data from statistics.gov.uk 

Identify a region and zonal units of interest from http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/

- Read them into R as an `sf` object
- Join-on data from a non-geographic object

- Add a data access section to your in progress portfolio

## Bonus 3: find another geographic or transport dataset hosted online and write code to download it

- Share the code on Teams or in a GitHub issue: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/issues

## Get official data with stats19

- Take a read of the stats19 README page and at least one of the articles on it here: https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/
- Install and load the stats19 package as with one of the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("stats19") # the stable version
# remotes::install_github("ropensci/stats19") # the most recent 'development' version
```

- Show crashes involving pedestrians in Manchester by reproducing the following lines of code:

```{r}
library(sf)
library(stats19)
library(tidyverse)
crashes_2018 = get_stats19(year = 2018)
crashes_2018_sf = format_sf(crashes_2018)
crashes_manchester = crashes_2018_sf %>% filter(local_authority_district == "Manchester")
plot(crashes_manchester["accident_severity"])
casualties_2018 = get_stats19(year = 2018, type = "cas")
crashes_manchester = inner_join(crashes_manchester, casualties_2018)
pedestrian_casualties = crashes_manchester %>% filter(casualty_type == "Pedestrian")
plot(pedestrian_casualties["accident_severity"])
```

- Use the tmap package to create an interactive map of pedestrian casualties in Manchester, starting with the following commands (hint, use `tmaptools::palette_explorer()` and the argument `palette = "Reds"` in the function `tm_dots()`, for example, to change the default colour palette):

```{r}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("plot")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(pedestrian_casualties) +
  tm_dots("accident_severity", palette = "RdYlBu")
```

- Based on the documentation at https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/:
  
  - Download data on road crashes in Great Britain in 2018
  - Filter crashes that happened in Leeds
  
- Bonus: make a map of pedestrian casualties in Leeds that shows the speed limit where pedestrians were hit. Explore the results in an interactive map. Where do you think the speed limit should be reduced based on this data?

The result should look something like this:

```{r}
crashes_leeds = crashes_2018_sf %>% filter(local_authority_district == "Leeds")
crashes_leeds = inner_join(crashes_leeds, casualties_2018)
pedestrian_casualties = crashes_leeds %>% filter(casualty_type == "Pedestrian")
tm_shape(pedestrian_casualties) +
  tm_dots("speed_limit")
```

- Bonus: what is the relationship between crash severity and the speed limit?

- Bonus: download and visualise the Leeds Bradford Cycle Superhighway data with these commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(osmdata)
data_osm = opq("leeds uk") %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "Cycle Superhighway 1") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
saveRDS(data_osm, "data_osm_cycle_superhighway.Rds")
piggyback::pb_upload("data_osm_cycle_superhighway.Rds")
piggyback::pb_download_url("data_osm_cycle_superhighway.Rds")
```


```{r}
# if the previous command fails, try:
data_osm = readRDS(url("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.20.1/data_osm_cycle_superhighway.Rds"))
cycleway_100m_buffer = stplanr::geo_buffer(data_osm$osm_lines, dist = 100)
crashes_leeds_lon_lat = crashes_leeds %>% st_transform(4326)
crashes_near_cycle_superhighway = crashes_leeds_lon_lat[cycleway_100m_buffer, ]
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(data_osm$osm_lines) + tm_lines() +
  tm_shape(crashes_near_cycle_superhighway) + tm_dots("casualty_type")
```

  - Filter crashes that happened within a 500 m buffer of the cycle infrastructure
  - Do cyclists seem safer on the cycle superhighway?
  - Bonus: pull down origin-destination data with the `pct` package hosted at: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct
