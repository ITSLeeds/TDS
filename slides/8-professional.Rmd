Remember the marking [criteria](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/coursework-template.md#04-marks):

--

    **Understanding of concepts, methods and approaches**

    **Data, processing access and cleaning**

## '2 pager' document on plans

- Well done everyone who submitted a .zip file containing an .Rmd file and a 1 page pdf

- Based on feedback that you received, and subsequent work, can each person state:

  - A draft title of your topic
  - The main dataset that you will use and other datasets that you could use
  - Ideas on a research question
  - Questions you would like to ask about the topic, e.g. 'is this a suitable dataset?'
  - 1 or more references to the academic literature related to the topic
  - Any preliminary analysis you have done

- Source: `coursework-template.Rmd` in the TDS GitHub repository

# Example

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
browseURL("~/OneDrive/career/modules/tds/examples/tds-coursework-example-2019-2020.pdf")
system("rg '201380814' ~/hd/backups/onedrive-backups/onedrive-big-mirror/career/modules/tds/2020-marks/")
system("rg test ~/hd/backups/onedrive-backups/onedrive-big-mirror/career/modules/tds/2020-marks/")
file.edit("~/hd/backups/onedrive-backups/onedrive-big-mirror/career/modules/tds/2020-marking/02/122554084-TDS_Coursework_Draft.tex")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/example-html.png")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("../figures/example-pdf.png")
```

Note: 

- Good structure
- Well written
- Reproducible


See `stats19-example.zip` in the [github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/tag/23](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/tag/23) for an an example of a coursework submission

## Data science workflows

# Managing time and prioritising ([Source](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html))

---

# Practical

- What are the strongest aspects of your coursework idea so far? What are the weakest?

--

- What are the priorities over the next three weeks (break it down into 3 parts) 

--

- What do you need to find more literature on?

--

- What do you need more data on (you should have all the data already)?

--

- What additional skills do you need (now is a good time to ask)?

<!-- ### What is machine learning? -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - [Applied statistics](https://machinelearningmastery.com/relationship-between-applied-statistics-and-machine-learning/) vs ML: a continuum -->

<!-- ![](https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Glossary-Mapping-Terms-in-Statistics-to-Terms-in-Machine-Learning.png) -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Machine learning types -->

<!-- There are 2 basic types `r Citep(my_bib, "james_introduction_2013a", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` -->

<!-- - Supervised learning, when you have a training dataset -->

<!-- - Unsupervised learning, where there is no 'dependent variable' -->


<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Deep learning -->

<!-- - Google is now 'AI First' (NYT [2016](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html)) -->

<!-- ![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/18/magazine/18ai8/18ai8-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp) -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Example of a machine learning problem -->

<!-- - Cycling infrastructure is a 'fuzzy' concept -->

<!-- - Difficult to pin down with a simple relationship -->

<!-- - So machine learning should help! -->

<!-- - See www.cyipt.bike -->

# Input data - messy

# Input data - simplification

<!-- # Results of ML exercise -->

<!-- See https://github.com/cyipt/cyipt/blob/master/model-uptake.md -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Observations -->

<!-- - Input data is very noisy -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Machine learning didn't reveal any expected insights in this case -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - But did reveal *unexpected* insight: road speeds and traffic volumes seem to be associated with lower uptake of cycling -->

# Working on your projects

- Plan ahead: what else do you need to do on your project?
- Schedule work: when will you find time to do it?
- Use Microsoft Calendar or similar: put it in the calendar.
- Reproducibility: ensure your .Rmd files are reproducible
- Ask for help: what do you need help with?
- Work: get you head down and make use of this time!
