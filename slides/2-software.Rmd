# GUIs vs CLIs

# First up: what are GUIs and CLIs?

```

Informally: pointy-clicky-programs

Formally: a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons

## In the context of geographic data

```{r, message=FALSE}
u = "https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/raw/master/extdata/gis-vs-gds-table.csv"
d = readr::read_csv(u)
knitr::kable(x = d, format = "html")
```

Source: Geocomputation with R `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

---

## Why is reproducibility important?

--

- For all the reasons covered in Lecture 1

--

- A more in-depth reason:

> A process in which the same results can be generated by others using publicly accessible code.

> This may sound simple and easy to achieve (which it is if you carefully maintain your R code in script files), but has profound implications for teaching and the scientific process
`r Citep(my_bib, "pebesma_r_2012", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`


---

## CLI vs GUI vs NUI

- There are other ways of interactive with computers!

```{r nuis, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin_Molina4/publication/304816895/figure/fig5/AS:667910355816460@1536253646575/The-User-Interface-evolution-Command-line-interfaces-began-the-UI-revolution-followed-by.jpg")
```

Source: `r Citep(my_bib, "fernandez_natural_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` 

---

## CLIs can be confusing

For example: 

> The general syntax of a GRASS
command which is called to run a module is similar to UNIX commands:

```
module [-flag1[flag2...]] parameter1=map1[,map2,...]\
[parameter2=number...] [--o] [--q] [--v]
```
`r Citep(my_bib, "neteler_open_2008", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` 

---

## Learning to use a CLI

- Takes time and practice

- Benefits massively from touch typing 

- See Efficient R Programming, Section [1.5](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/introduction.html#cross-transferable-skills-for-efficiency) `r Citep(my_bib, "gillespie_efficient_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

## Transport-related tools

---

## OSMnx

```{r, engine='python', eval=FALSE}
import networkx as nx
import osmnx as ox
import requests
import matplotlib.cm as cm
import matplotlib.colors as colors
# after fixing a couple of issues, e.g. with https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx/issues/45 and:
# Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords) : 
#   ImportError: Something is wrong with the numpy installation. While importing we detected an older version of numpy in ['/home/robin/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy']. One method of fixing this is to repeatedly uninstall numpy until none is found, then reinstall this version. 
# ... I can do this:
G = ox.graph_from_place('bangor', network_type='drive')
ox.plot_graph(ox.project_graph(G)) # note this was sloooow!
```

## Features of osmnx

- Based on OSM street networks
- Functions to correct/simplify street topology
- Many street network measures implemented
- Can do routing
- More info, see the paper 
`r Citep(my_bib, "boeing_osmnx_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` 

---

## Features of stplanr

- Designed after creating functions for the pct.bike project
- Focus on origin-destinatioin data
- Also handles route networks and local routing (work in progress)
- An assortment of other functions
- Has since let to 2 other packages:
  - cyclestreets (for accessing cyclestreets.net data)
  - stats19 for accessing crash data
- More info, see the stplanr paper, or ask the author ;) `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_stplanr_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` 

---

## In R / stplanr

```{r netr}
library(sf)
# net = dodgr::dodgr_streetnet("bangor")
library(osmdata)
net = opq("bangor") %>% 
  add_osm_feature("highway") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
```

---

## Plotting in R

```{r}
plot(net$osm_lines$geometry)
```


---

## An operation on the network

```{r}
sel_speed = !is.na(net$osm_lines$maxspeed)
summary(sel_speed)
fast_roads = net$osm_lines[sel_speed, ]
m = mapview::mapview(fast_roads)
m@map
```
