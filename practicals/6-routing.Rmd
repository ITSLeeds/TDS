## Setting Up (10 minutes)
The first step is to install the necessary packages for this practial. Unfortunately, some of the most interesting packages for routing are not yet available on CRAN. In this practical we will introduce three CRAN packages [cyclestreets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cyclestreets/index.html), [dodgr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dodgr/index.html), and [igraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html) and one GitHub package [transportAPI](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/transportAPI).

There are also some bonus exercises using the [Open Trip Planner](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/opentripplanner)

To install packages from GitHub you will need the `devtools` package. **Note:** GitHub packages have not been reviewed so install at your own risk.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install packages from CRAN (as required)
list.of.packages <- c("sf", "stplanr","cyclestreets","devtools","dodgr","igraph","usethis","tmap")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
rm(list.of.packages, new.packages)

# Install packages from GitHub
devtools::install_github("mem48/transportAPI")
devtools::install_github("ITSleeds/opentripplanner") # For the bonus exercises

# Load packages
library(sf)
library(stplanr)
library(tmap)
library(cyclestreets)
library(transportAPI)
library(dodgr)

```


To use the cycletreets package you will need to get an API key for [cyclestreets](https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/apply/)

Now you will need to add your CycleStreets API key to your R Environment

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
# Add CYCLESTREETS=your_key_here as a new line in your .Renviron file
```

You may need to restart R for the changes to come into effect.

You can also get an API key for TransportAPI, but it will not be necessary for this practial.

We will also need some sample data, for this practical we will be using data about the Isle of Wight.

* Commuter flow data from the [PCT](https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw/master/commute/msoa/isle-of-wight/od_attributes.csv)
* MSOA centroids from the [PCT](https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw/master/commute/msoa/isle-of-wight/c.geojson)
* The Open Street Map for the Isle of Wight from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain/england/isle-of-wight.html)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
flow <- read.csv("https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw/master/commute/msoa/isle-of-wight/od_attributes.csv",
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
flow <- flow[flow$geo_code1 != flow$geo_code2,]
flow <- flow[flow$all > 600,] # Subset out the largest flows

centroids <- sf::read_sf("https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw/master/commute/msoa/isle-of-wight/c.geojson")
centroids <- centroids[,"geo_code"]

roads <- sf::read_sf("http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain/england/isle-of-wight-latest.osm.pbf", layer = "lines")
roads <- roads[!is.na(roads$highway),] # Subset to just the roads
```

## Basic Routing (20 minutes)

Let's start with finding a simple route from A to B. We will use two different routing services

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
from <- c(-1.155884, 50.72186)
to <- c(-1.173878, 50.72301)
r_cs <- cyclestreets::journey(from, to)
r_tapi <- transportAPI::tapi_journey(from, to, apitype = "public", base_url = "http://fcc.transportapi.com/")
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(r_cs) +
  qtm(r_tapi)

```

Notice that `cyclestreets` has returned 8 rows, one for each road on the journey. While TransportAPI has returned 4 rows one row representing a direct walk, the other three a walk, bus, walk route. Notice the `route_option` and `route_stage` columns.

Let's suppose you want a single line for each route.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
r_cs$routeID <- 1
r_cs <- r_cs %>%
  dplyr::group_by(routeID) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(distances = sum(distances),
            time = sum(time),
            busynance = sum(time))

```

We now have a single row but instead of a `LINESTRING` wen now have a `MULTILINESTRING`, we can convert to a linestring by using `st_line_merge()`. Note how the different columns where summarised.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_geometry_type(r_cs)
r_cs <- st_line_merge(r_cs)
st_geometry_type(r_cs)
```

**Exercise**
Experiment with routing can you find out how to:

* Route for driving and cycling using transportAPI
* Change the date and time of travel with transportAPI
* Find fast and quiet routes from cyclestreets

Hint: Try using `?tapi_journey` to view the help files

## Batch Routing (20 minutes)

One route is useful, may many routes is better! We will find the routes for the 8 most commuter desire lines on the Isle of Wight. First, we must turn the flow data into a set of start and end points. We will use the `stplanr` package. The `od2odf` function returns the start and end coordinates by combing the `flow` and `centroids` datasets by the shared `geo_code`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
flow2 <- stplanr::od2odf(flow[,c("geo_code1","geo_code2")], as(centroids,"Spatial")) 
# Note this function does not currently work with SF, so as("Spatial") required
head(flow2)
```


The `cyclestreets` package doe not have an inbuilt batch routing option so we must build a simple loop

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
routes_cs <- list()
for(i in 1:nrow(flow2)){
  r_cs_sub <- cyclestreets::journey(as.numeric(flow2[i,3:4]), as.numeric(flow2[i,5:6]))
  r_cs_sub$routeID <- paste0(flow2$code_o[i]," ",flow2$code_d[i])
  routes_cs[[i]] <- r_cs_sub
}
```

This leaves us with a list of data.frames. Which we can combine using `do.call(rbind)`. **Note** for large lists this is slow. consider using `dplyr::bind_rows()` and rebuilding the geometry column. We can also group them into a single line for each route.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
routes_cs <- do.call(rbind,routes_cs)
routes_cs <- routes_cs %>%
  dplyr::group_by(routeID) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(distances = sum(distances),
            time = sum(time),
            busynance = sum(time))
qtm(routes_cs)
```

The `transportAPI` package has a builtin batch routing function, and will also accept an SF point input.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
from <- dplyr::left_join(flow, centroids, by = c("geo_code1" = "geo_code"))
to   <- dplyr::left_join(flow, centroids, by = c("geo_code2" = "geo_code"))
routes_tapi <- transportAPI::tapi_journey_batch(from$geometry, to$geometry, 
                                                from$geo_code1, to$geo_code2,
                                                base_url = "http://fcc.transportapi.com/")

```

**Exercises**

Examine the different results produced by cyclestreets and transportAPI.

* how would you compare travel times by bike an public transport?

## Network Analysis (dodgr) (20 minutes)

We will now look to analyse the road network using `dodgr`. Fist lets find the distances between all our centroids for a cyclist. `dodgr_dists` returns a matrix of distances in km, note the speed of using dodgr to find 64 distances compared to using a routing service. `dodgr` works well for these type of calcualtion, but cannot do public transport timetables.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
streetnet <- dodgr::weight_streetnet(roads)
distances <- dodgr::dodgr_dists(streetnet, as.matrix(flow2[,3:4]), as.matrix(flow2[,5:6]))
colnames(distances) <- flow2$code_d
rownames(distances) <- flow2$code_o
distances
```

`dodgr` can also aggregate flows across a network, this allows you to find the total number of cyclists on a particular road.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Make a flow count matrix
flow3 <- data.frame(geo_code1 = rep(flow$geo_code1, times = nrow(flow)),
                    geo_code2 = rep(flow$geo_code2, each = nrow(flow)))
flow3 <- dplyr::left_join(flow3, flow[,c("geo_code1","geo_code2","bicycle")], by = c("geo_code1","geo_code2"))
flow3$bicycle[is.na(flow3$bicycle)] <- 0
flow3 <- matrix(flow3$bicycle, nrow = nrow(flow), byrow = TRUE)
flow3 
# Aggregate the flows across the road network
streetnet <- dodgr::dodgr_flows_aggregate(streetnet, as.matrix(flow2[,3:4]), as.matrix(flow2[,5:6]), flows = flow3)
```

To visualise the results we must convert the `dodgr` graph back to an `sf` object.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Make a flow count matrix
roads_flow <- dodgr::dodgr_to_sfc(streetnet)
roads_flow <- sf::st_sf(cbind(roads_flow$dat, roads_flow$geometry))
roads_flow <- roads_flow[roads_flow$flow > 0,]
qtm(roads_flow, lines.col = "flow", lines.lwd = 3)
```

**Exercises**
The method above has introduced some double counting can you find and fix the flaw?

Try re-downloading the whole flow dataset and producing route network for the whole of the Isle of Wight.

## Network Analysis (igraph) (20 minutes)

`igraph` is a package for analysing all types of network, we will use `igraph` to identify any bottlenecks in the road network. We will do this by calculating the betweenness centrality of the major road network. The will provide a measure of the most "important" roads in the network. As this calculation takes a long time we will only do it for the major roads.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# subset to main roads
roads <- roads[roads$highway %in% c("primary","secondary","tertiary"),]

streetnet <- dodgr::weight_streetnet(roads) #39074
streetnet_cont <- dodgr::dodgr_contract_graph(streetnet) # Simplify the street network
# convert to igraph and calualte betweeness
streetnet_cont$graph$flow <- 0 # fix as bug with weight_streetnet
graph <- dodgr::dodgr_to_igraph(streetnet_cont$graph)
betweenness <- igraph::edge_betweenness(graph, directed = F) # This will take a while

# Transfer Value from contracted graph to main graph
streetnet_cont$graph$between <- betweenness
graph_join <- dplyr::left_join(streetnet_cont$edge_map, streetnet_cont$graph[,c("edge_id","between")], by = c("edge_new" = "edge_id"))
graph_join$edge_old <- as.integer(graph_join$edge_old)
streetnet <- dplyr::left_join(streetnet, graph_join, by = c("edge_id" = "edge_old"))
roads_betweeness <- dodgr::dodgr_to_sfc(streetnet)
roads_betweeness <- sf::st_sf(cbind(roads_betweeness$dat, roads_betweeness$geometry))
qtm(roads_betweeness, lines.col = "between", lines.lwd = 3)
```

## Bonus Material (30 minutes)

Open Trip Planner (OTP) is a powerful multimodal route planner written in JAVA. The `opentripplanner` package allows you to set up and use the OTP from R.
