Dear Students and Data Scientists,

# First lecture

As per your [timetable](http://timetable.leeds.ac.uk/teaching/202223/reporting/Individual?objectclass=module&idtype=name&identifier=TRAN5340M01&&template=SWSCUST+module+Individual&days=1-7&weeks=1-52&periods=1-21), the first lecture is tomorrow, Monday 30th January, from 11:00 to 12:00.

**Location:** [Lecture Theatre (LT) B (3.23)](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/rooms#building=Civil-Engineering&room=//students.leeds.ac.uk/rooms?type=room&id=99885), [Civil Engineering Building](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/rooms#building=Civil-Engineering).

Instructions on how to get there: https://students.leeds.ac.uk/rooms#building=Civil-Engineering&room=//students.leeds.ac.uk/rooms?type=room&id=99885

See below for the location:

Please ensure that you arrive in good time, by 10:55, so you have time to get a seat in time for the 11:00 start.

## Welcome

Welcome to Transport Data Science.
In this module you will learn data science skills and how to apply them to solve real world problems, with a focus on transport planning.
Transport is by definition a geographic phenomenon, meaning the movement from one place to another: "the purpose of transportation is to overcome space" [@rodrigue_geography_2013].

Becoming good at transport data science therefore means becoming good at data science in general and geographic data science in particular.
2021 is an exciting time to be learning data science for transport applications.
A wide range of new and open source tools, combined with unprecedented amounts of new data, enable researchers to visualise/model/understand transport systems in more breadth and depth than ever before [@lovelace_open_2021].

## About the course

Based on an understanding of the evolving nature of data science as a collaborative and open source code-driven enterprise, this module takes a 'learning by doing' approach.
The contact time will consist of

-   5 \* one hour lectures that will be released as videos at the beginning of each week (starting from next week)
-   5 \* 2.5 hour practicals in which we will work through data science problems and solutions together
-   A seminar consisting of an hour of an external speaker talking about transport data science used in the wild
-   most importantly, you will dedicate substantial time (several hours per week) to practicing data science, resulting in a reproducible project portfolio in which you will demonstrate your data science skills

The module timetable is shown in the table below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
timetable = read_csv("../timetable.csv")
# timetable = read_csv("timetable.csv")
timetable %>% 
  select(-description) %>% 
  rename_with(str_to_title) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

You will need to work hard to become a proficient data scientist in the transport domain.
The work presented in the table above will provide you with the foundation you need to progress.
But you will need to bring a vital ingredient to the course: passion.

## Homework for next week

The first thing you should do is ensure that you have the timetable stored safely in your calendar, so you do not miss important practicals or seminars.
<!-- You can watch the lectures in your own time but you *must* ensure you have watched each one and taken notes before each practical session on Thursdays. -->

The second thing you should do is ensure that you have the necessary software installed on your computer and that you have tested that you can use it for the datasets we will be using in the course.
**You must read and try to complete the exercises in Chapters 1 to 4 of the book Reproducible Road Safety Research with R.** Most important section of those 4 chapters is Section 1.5, which explains how to install R and RStudio.
This is not a theoretical section: I suggest you follow the instructions here ASAP: <https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/introduction.html#installing-r-and-rstudio>

Other key chapters in that resources are:

-   Chapter 2 on the basics of the statistical programming language R: <https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/basics.html>
-   Chapter 3 on using RStudio: <https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/rstudio.html>
-   Chapter 4 on installing R packages, **make sure you can install packages such as sf**: <https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/pkgs.html>

The third and final thing to do is to *engage* with the reading content and platforms associated with this module.
See the reading list associated with the module at <https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md#reading-list>.
Read-up on the references and links provided in the References section below.
Check out the course's online home on the GitHub platform at <https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS>.
(Fun fact, you can find the source code underlying this message [here](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/messages/welcome.Rmd).) To collaborate on GitHub you should sign-up to get a GitHub account here: <https://github.com/> After you have a GitHub account you can ask questions by opening an 'Issue' in the project's repository, a common way for professional data scientists to communicate about code and their work: <https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/issues/> And ensure you can access the Transport Data Science Team on Microsoft Teams and please do say hello, as shown below.

<!-- ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/106159315-8f1fd880-617c-11eb-91be-1a6a123082b2.png) -->

And please do ask any questions do ask, either via email or preferably on Minerva or via a GitHub issue.
It's always better ask than to 'suffer in silence!'

I really look forward to working with you all to make this a successful and enjoyable module.
