## Setting Up (10 minutes)

We will use [ITS Go](https://itsleeds.github.io/go/) to do an easy setup of your computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("https://git.io/JvGjF")
```

If that does not work the packages we will be using are:

* sf
* tidyverse
* tmap
* pct
* stplanr
* dodgr
* opentripplanner
* igraph
* ITSleeds/geofabrik

## Using OpenTripPlanner to get routes

We have setup the Multi-modal routing service OpenTripPlanner for West Yorkshire. Try typing the URL shown during the session into your broswer. You should see somthign like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="\\label{fig:otpgui}OTP Web GUI"}
knitr::include_graphics("otp_screenshot.png")
```

**Exercise**: Play with the web interface, finding different types of routes. What strengths/limitations can you find?

### Connecting to OpenTripPlanner

To allow R to connect to the OpenTripPlanner server, we will use the `opentripplanner` package and the function `otp_connect`. In this example I have saved the hostname of the server as a variable called "robinIP" in my Renviron file by using `usethis::edit_r_environ()` 

However, you can also just set it manually.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(stplanr)
library(opentripplanner)
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
otpcon <- otp_connect(hostname = Sys.getenv("robinIP"), port = 8080)
```

If you have connected successfully, then you should get a message "Router exists."

To get some routes, we will start by importing some data we have used previously.

```{r, message=FALSE}
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.1/desire_lines.geojson"
download.file(u, "desire_lines.geojson")
desire_lines = read_sf("desire_lines.geojson")
```

**Exercise** Subset the `desire_lines` data frame so that it only has the folloing columns:
"geo_code1", "geo_code2", "all", "bicycle", "foot", "car_driver", "car_passenger", "train", "taxi", "motorbike", and "geometry"   

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
desire_lines = desire_lines[,c("geo_code1", "geo_code2", "all", "bicycle", "foot", "car_driver", "car_passenger", "train", "taxi", "motorbike")]
```

This dataset has desire lines, but most routing packages need start and endpoints, so we will extract the points from the lines using the `line2df` function. An then select the top 3 desire lines.

```{r, message=FALSE}
desire = bind_cols(desire_lines, line2df(desire_lines))
desire = st_drop_geometry(desire)
desire_top = top_n(desire, 3, all)
```


To find the routes for these desire lines.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
routes_top = otp_plan(otpcon,
                      fromPlace = as.matrix(desire_top[,c("fx","fy")]),
                      toPlace = as.matrix(desire_top[,c("tx","ty")]),
                      mode = "CAR")

```

We can plot those routes using the `tmap` package.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(routes_top)
```

We can also get Isochonres from OTP.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
isochrone = otp_isochrone(otpcon, fromPlace = c(-1.558655, 53.807870), 
                          mode = c("BICYCLE","TRANSIT"),
                          maxWalkDistance = 3000)
isochrone$time = isochrone$time / 60
isochrone <- st_buffer(isochrone, 0)
qtm(isochrone, fill = "time")
```

To save overloading the server I have pre-generated some extra routes.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
routes_drive = otp_plan(otpcon,
                      fromPlace = as.matrix(desire[,c("fx","fy")]),
                      toPlace = as.matrix(desire[,c("tx","ty")]),
                      fromID = desire$geo_code1,
                      toID = desire$geo_code2,
                      mode = "CAR",
                      ncore = 4)



routes_transit = otp_plan(otpcon,
                      fromPlace = as.matrix(desire[,c("fx","fy")]),
                      toPlace = as.matrix(desire[,c("tx","ty")]),
                      fromID = desire$geo_code1,
                      toID = desire$geo_code2,
                      mode = c("TRANSIT","WALK"),
                      maxWalkDistance = 1500,
                      ncore = 4)
write_sf(routes_drive,"driving_routes.gpkg")
write_sf(routes_transit,"transit_routes.gpkg")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
routes_drive = read_sf("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.20.1/driving_routes.gpkg")
routes_transit = read_sf("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.20.1/transit_routes.gpkg")
```

**Exercise** Examine these two new datasets `routes_drive` and `routes_transit` plot them on a map, what useful information do they contain what is missing?

Finally, let's join the routes to the original desire dataset.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
desire_drive = left_join(desire, routes_drive, by = c("geo_code1" = "fromPlace", 
                                                      "geo_code2" = "toPlace"))
```

Note that some of the desire lines do not have a route. This is usually because the start or endpoint is too far from the road.

**Exercise** How many routes are missing for each mode? How could you improve this method, so there were no missing routes?

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
summary(is.na(desire_drive$duration))
desire_drive = desire_drive[is.na(desire_drive$duration),]
```

## Line Merging

Notice that `routes_transit` has returned separate rows for each mode (WALK, RAIL). Notice the `route_option` column shows that some routes have multiple options.

Let's suppose you want a single line for each route.

**Exercise**: Filter the `routes_transit` to contain only one route option per origin-destination pair.
**Bonus Exercise**: Do the above but make sure you always select the fastest option.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
routes_transit <- routes_transit[routes_transit$route_option == 1,]
```

Now We will group the separate parts of the routes together.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}

routes_transit_group <- routes_transit %>%
  dplyr::group_by(fromPlace, toPlace) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(duration = sum(duration),
                   startTime = min(startTime),
                   endTime = max(endTime),
                   distance = sum(distance))

```

We now have a single row, but instead of a `LINESTRING` we now have a mix of `MULTILINESTRING` and `LINESTRING`, we can convert to a linestring by using `st_line_merge()`. Note how the different columns where summarised.

First, we must separate out the `MULTILINESTRING` and `LINESTRING`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
routes_transit_group_ml <- routes_transit_group[st_geometry_type(routes_transit_group) == "MULTILINESTRING", ]
routes_transit_group <- routes_transit_group[st_geometry_type(routes_transit_group) != "MULTILINESTRING", ]
routes_transit_group_ml <- st_line_merge(routes_transit_group_ml)
routes_transit_group <- rbind(routes_transit_group, routes_transit_group_ml)
```


## Network Analysis (dodgr) (20 minutes)

We will now look to analyse the road network using `dodgr`. First lets find the distances between all our centroids for a cyclist. `dodgr_dists` returns a matrix of distances in km, note the speed of using dodgr to find 64 distances compared to using a routing service. `dodgr` works well for these type of calculation, but cannot do public transport timetables.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(geofabrik)
library(dodgr)
library(igraph)
roads = get_geofabrik("isle-of-wight")
roads = roads[!is.na(roads$highway),]
roads = roads[,c( "osm_id","name","highway","maxspeed","oneway","lanes","bridge","foot","bicycle","lit","footway")]
roads = roads[!roads$highway %in% c("proposed","construction"),]
graph = weight_streetnet(roads)
```

**Exercise**: Reproduce the Isle of Wight flow data `d_iow_origins` that you used in the Data Cleaning Practical

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
d = read_csv("wu03ew_v2.csv")
zones = pct::get_pct_zones(region = "isle-of-wight", geography = "msoa")
names(d) = snakecase::to_snake_case(names(d))
names(d)[5] = "metro"
d_iow_origins = d %>% 
  filter(area_of_residence %in% zones$geo_code) %>%
  filter(area_of_workplace %in% zones$geo_code)
```

Now we need to add coordinates to these flows. Let's use the population-weighted centroids in the `pct` package.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
centroids = pct::get_pct_centroids("isle-of-wight", geography = "msoa")
centroids = centroids[,"geo_code"]
```

We can extract the coordinates out of a geometry column using `st_coordinates`

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
centroids = bind_cols(centroids, as.data.frame(st_coordinates(centroids)))
centroids = st_drop_geometry(centroids)
```

`dodgr` can also aggregate flows across a network; this allows you to find the total number of cyclists on a particular road.


```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
iow_od = od_to_odmatrix(d_iow_origins)
centroids = centroids[match(centroids$geo_code, rownames(iow_od)),]
summary(rownames(iow_od) == centroids$geo_code)

verts = match_points_to_graph(verts = dodgr_vertices(graph), as.matrix(centroids[,c("X","Y")]))

net = dodgr_flows_aggregate(graph, verts, verts, flows = iow_od)
net = merge_directed_flows(net)
# dodgr_flowmap(net) built in plotting
net_sf = dodgr::dodgr_to_sf(net)
qtm(net_sf, lines.col = "flow", lines.lwd = 3)
```


## Network Analysis (igraph) (20 minutes)

`igraph` is a package for analysing all types of network; we will use `igraph` to identify any bottlenecks in the road network. We will do this by calculating the betweenness centrality of the major road network. The will provide a measure of the most "important" roads in the network. As this calculation takes a long time, we will only do it for the major roads.

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# subset to main roads
graph2 <- graph[graph$highway %in% c("primary","secondary","tertiary"),] 
graph2 <- dodgr_contract_graph(graph) # Simplify the street network
# convert to igraph and calualte betweeness
graph2_ig <- dodgr_to_igraph(graph2)
betweenness <- igraph::edge_betweenness(graph2_ig, directed = FALSE, normalized = TRUE) # This will take a while

# Transfer Value from contracted graph to main graph
graph2$between <- betweenness
graph2_sf = dodgr::dodgr_to_sf(graph2)
qtm(graph2_sf, lines.col = "between", lines.lwd = 3)

graph_join <- dplyr::left_join(streetnet_cont$edge_map, streetnet_cont$graph[,c("edge_id","between")], by = c("edge_new" = "edge_id"))
graph_join$edge_old <- as.integer(graph_join$edge_old)
streetnet <- dplyr::left_join(streetnet, graph_join, by = c("edge_id" = "edge_old"))
roads_betweeness <- dodgr::dodgr_to_sfc(streetnet)
roads_betweeness <- sf::st_sf(cbind(roads_betweeness$dat, roads_betweeness$geometry))
qtm(roads_betweeness, lines.col = "between", lines.lwd = 3)
```

## Bonus Material (30 minutes)

Open Trip Planner (OTP) is a powerful multimodal route planner written in JAVA. The `opentripplanner` package allows you to set up and use the OTP from R.
