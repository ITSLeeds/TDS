## Prior set-up and reading (before practical)

We will use [ITS Go](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/go) to do an easy setup of your computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("https://git.io/JvGjF")
```

If that does not work the packages we will be using are:

* sf
* tidyverse
* tmap
* pct
* stplanr
* dodgr
* opentripplanner
* igraph
* osmextract

Make sure that you have installed these.

Read the OpenTripPlanner package paper for information on routing [@morgan_opentripplanner_2019].



Note: for this practical to work you need to have installed a recent version of `stplanr` (at least version 0.8.7).
Check the version you have installed with the following command:

```{r}
packageVersion("stplanr")
```

Install the latest CRAN version with the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") # install the remotes package
```

If the installation fails, install `terra` with the [following command](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('terra', repos='https://rspatial.r-universe.dev')
```


```{r}
remotes::install_cran("stplanr") # install the stplanr package if not up-to-date
```
