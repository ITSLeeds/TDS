This package builds on the [routing practical](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/practicals/6-routing.md) and demonstrates ways to analyse OD and route network data.

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "50%", warning = FALSE)
```

As before we will use the `tidyverse`, `tmap` and `sf` packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)
library(sf)
```

## Input data

- Get data on the zones in West Yorkshire with the following command:

```{r}
zones = pct::get_pct_zones(region = "west-yorkshire", geography = "msoa")
```

- Get origin-destination data with the following commands:

```{r}
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.1/desire_lines.geojson"
download.file(u, "desire_lines.geojson")
desire_lines = read_sf("desire_lines.geojson")
```


## Exploratory analysis of zone data

- Find out the class, names, number of columns and number of rows in the  `zones` dataset using functions such as `names()`, `nrow()` and `ncol()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
names(zones)
dim(zones)
# [1] 299 130
dim(desire_lines)
# [1] 502  10
```

- Explore the link between the `zones` and `desire_lines` datasets: what percentage of 'zone IDs' (codes that identify the zones) can be found in the desire lines object (either as zones of origin or destination)?
  - Hint: you can break this question into pieces:
    - The following command will generate a vector containing logical (boolean) values, each `TRUE` when the corresponding zone ID is contained within the `desire_lines` variable: `zones_in_o = zones$geo_code %in% desire_lines$geo_code1`
  - What percentage of the desire lines are contained within West Yorkshire (and how did you find out)? NB West Yorkshire zones are Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield
  
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
zones_in_o = zones$geo_code %in% desire_lines$geo_code1
summary(zones_in_o)
summary(zones$geo_code %in% desire_lines$geo_code1)
#    Mode   FALSE    TRUE 
# logical      22     227
227 / 299 # 76%
summary(zones$geo_code %in% desire_lines$geo_code2)
#    Mode   FALSE    TRUE 
# logical      63     236 
236 / 299 # 79%
from_and_to = c(desire_lines$geo_code1, desire_lines$geo_code2)
summary(zones$geo_code %in% from_and_to)
299 / 299 # 100%
```

- Plot the number of car trips and walking trips as follows, what do you notice about the results? Where is most potential to increase walking levels, based on these results?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(zones["car_driver"])
plot(zones["foot"])
```

- How would you select only the `car_driver` column in the zones object in the tidyverse? Hint it would begin with the following (incomplete) lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
zones %>% select(
```

- Create an object called `zones_car_foot` that only contains columns representing the number of trips originating in each zone by car and foot.
  - Plot the object, you should see something like the figure below.
  
```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
zones_car_foot = zones %>% 
  select(car_driver, foot)
plot(zones_car_foot)
```


- Create a new object called `zones_active_modes` that is identical to the `zones` object but which has a new column called `active`, containing the number of people walking plus the number of people cycling to work (hint: use the function `mutate()`. Plot the spatial distribution of trips made by car and active modes in a facetted map (hint, use `tm_fill(c("active", "car_driver"))`). The results should look like those below (bonus, create a scatter plot showing the relationship between these variables).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
zones_active_modes = zones %>% 
  mutate(active = bicycle + foot)
tm_shape(zones_active_modes) +
  tm_fill(c("active", "car_driver"), palette = "viridis")
zones_active_modes %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(active, car_driver))
```

- Which zone has the highest level of cycling, and where is it?
- Use the function `filter()` to create an object only containing that zone

### Desire lines

Plot the lines statically as follows:

```{r}
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines()
```

Plot the lines showing the number of car drivers as follows:

```{r}
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(col = "car_driver")
```

- Plot the same lines, but with colour according to the number of people who walked to work in the 2011 Census

```{r, include=FALSE}
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(col = "foot")
```

- Re-do the plot of the number of trips made by driving, but make the line widths proportional to the total number (`all`) trips made (hint: you may need to set the scale with `scale = 5`, or another number greater than 1, for example)

```{r, include=FALSE}
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(col = "foot", lwd = "all", scale = 9)
```

Filter-out all lines between 1 and 3km and call the resulting object`desire_lines_1_3km` with the following command (or similar):

```{r}
desire_lines_1_3km = desire_lines %>% 
  filter(e_dist_km > 1 & e_dist_km < 3)
```

- Plot the results to make sure the operation worked (you should get a result like the on below):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(desire_lines_1_3km$geometry)
```

Create a new variable called `percent_drive` that contains the percentage of trips driven in each of the lines in the `desire_lines_1_3km` object with the following command:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
desire_lines_pcar = desire_lines_1_3km %>% 
  mutate(percent_drive = car_driver / all * 100)
```

- Find the top 100 most 'car dependent' short desire lines in West Yorkshire and plot the results. It should look something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
car_dep_100 = desire_lines_pcar %>% 
  top_n(n = 100, wt = percent_drive)
tm_shape(car_dep_100) +
  tm_lines(col = "percent_drive", lwd = "all", scale = 5)
```

- Plot the results in an interactive map and explore the results. Where are the top 100 most car-dependent major commuting desire lines in West Yorkshire (hint: you may use the `ttm()` function to switch to interactive mode in **tmap**)?


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ttm()
tm_shape(car_dep_100) +
  tm_lines(col = "percent_drive", lwd = "all", scale = 5)
```

To get not only the most car dependent desire lines but route segments, run the following commands:

```{r}
# warning, takes some time, skip this chunk to speed-up results
routes = pct::get_pct_routes_fast("west-yorkshire", geography = "msoa") 
routes_dep_100 = routes %>% 
  filter(id %in% car_dep_100$id)
saveRDS(routes_dep_100, "routes_dep_100.Rds")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
piggyback::pb_upload("routes_dep_100.Rds")
piggyback::pb_download_url("routes_dep_100.Rds")
```

You can read-in the results as follows:

```{r}
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/22/routes_dep_100.Rds"
download.file(url = u, destfile = "routes_dep_100.Rds")
routes_dep_100 = readRDS("routes_dep_100.Rds")
```

To convert these routes into route segments, with estimates of n. people driving on different parts of the network (based on a small sample of total travel), use the overline function (see `?overline` for help):

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rnet_dep_100 = stplanr::overline(routes_dep_100, attrib = "car_driver")
# rnet_top = rnet_dep_100 %>% 
#  top_n(n = 100, wt = car_driver)
tm_shape(rnet_dep_100) +
  tm_lines(lwd = "car_driver", scale = 9)
```

What could be done to reduce car dependency in these areas?

Bonus: undertake the analysis above but using desire lines from the NTEM project.

- Read them in with the following commands:

```{r}
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/22/NTEM_flow.geojson"
desire_lines = read_sf(u)
head(desire_lines)
```

## Homework

Make a start on your coursework and the '2 pager'.

Take a read of the documentation for the abstr package: https://a-b-street.github.io/abstr/ that will be useful preparation for the seminar.

Reproduce the results presented in the [transport chapter of Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) for another region, e.g. West Yorkshire. This starting point may be useful:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
region = "west-yorkshire"
b = "https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw"
u = paste0("/master/commute/msoa/", region)
u_od = paste0(b, u, "/od_attributes.csv")
od = readr::read_csv(u_od)
z = sf::read_sf(paste0(b, u, "/z.geojson"))
cents = sf::read_sf(paste0(b, u, "/c.geojson"))
od_clean = od %>% 
  select(-id) %>% 
  filter(geo_code1 %in% cents$geo_code) %>% 
  filter(geo_code2 %in% cents$geo_code) 

  
desire_lines = stplanr::od2line(flow = od_clean, cents)
tm_shape(desire_lines$geometry[1:99]) %>% 
  tm_lines()
```
