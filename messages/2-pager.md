Dear All,

A couple of you asked about submitting the 2 page report before the
deadline of 22nd April and I wanted to provide a response to everyone.

Good news: early submissions are very welcome. We can start providing
feedback as soon as reports are submitted, meaning you will get more
valuable time to act on the feedback if you submit before. The
[submission box is now open on
Minerva](https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_551386_1/outline/assessment/test/_11896344_1?courseId=_551386_1&gradeitemView=details).

For guidance on what you should submit, see:

- See
  [here](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/24/2-pager.zip)
  an example of how to upload a .zip file with the .qmd document and the
  pdf that it produces. Note: you can download and unzip this folder and
  reproduce the .qmd document, see the pdf for examples of how to add
  citations.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
