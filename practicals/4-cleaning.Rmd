## Review of homework exercise: demo then individual Q&A

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```

## Simple data cleaning

**Exercies** Try evaluating these lines of code, what goes wrong how could you fix them? IS the only one "correct" solution discuss in pairs how you would approach different types of data cleaning.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
as.numeric(c("1","2.2","3,3"))
as.numeric(c("1","","3.3"))
sum(c(3,4,NA))
mean(c(3,4,NA))
max(c(3,4,NA))
d1 <- as.Date("31/11/2020")
d2 <- Sys.Date()
difftime(d2, d1)
NULL == NA
is.logical(NA)
is.null(NA)
is.na(NULL)
is.numeric("1")
is.numeric(1,2)
anyNA(c(6,2,NA))
for(i in 1:1){
  message(i)
}
0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3 == 0
```

## Data cleaning on a big dataset

Download the file `wu03ew_v2.zip` from the Wicid website:
[wicid.ukdataservice.ac.uk](http://wicid.ukdataservice.ac.uk/cider/wicid/downloads.php).
You should be able to read it in as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
unzip("~/Downloads/wu03ew_v2.zip")
d = read_csv("wu03ew_v2.csv")
```

Load data representing MSOA zones in Isle of Wight. 
You could download zones from a number of places, including https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/get-data/geography.aspx

An easy way to get zone data for West-Yorkshire is with the `pct` package, which can be installed as follows:

The zones for Isle of Wight can be shown as follows.

```{r, message=FALSE}
zones = pct::get_pct_zones(region = "isle-of-wight", geography = "msoa")
plot(zones$geometry)
```

## Processing/cleaning

- Clean the names of the `d` object, e.g. using the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
names(d) = snakecase::to_snake_case(names(d))
names(d)[5] = "metro"
```

- Create a new variable called `pcycle` representing the percentage cycling in each OD pair

- Create a minimal version of the dataset `d` only containing a few key variables

- What proportion of people in England and Wales are represented in the dataset `d`

- Create a subset of the object `d` called `d_iow_origins` that only contains routes that originate in Isle of Wight

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
head(zones$geo_code)
head(d$area_of_residence)

summary(d$area_of_residence %in% zones$geo_code)

d_iow_origins = d %>% 
  filter(area_of_residence %in% zones$geo_code) %>%
  filter(area_of_workplace %in% zones$geo_code)
```

- Create a subset that contains only od pairs with origins and destinations in Isle of Wight

**Bonus: Convert the origin-destination data you have of Isle of Wight into desire lines**, e.g. with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
desire_lines = stplanr::od2line(flow = d_iow_origins, zones)
desire_top = desire_lines %>% top_n(100, bicycle)
plot(desire_top)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mapview::mapview(desire_top)
```

## Working on your own datset / project portfolio

- Identify, download and clean a dataset to include in your coursework portfolio .Rmd document

## Homework

- Consolidate your knowledge of data cleaning by adding reproducible data cleaning code to your in-progress project portfolio.
