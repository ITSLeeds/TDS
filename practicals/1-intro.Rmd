## Thinking about (transport) data science {-}

<!-- - Based on the contents of the lecture, come up with *your own* definition of data science -->
- How do you see yourself using data science over the next 5 years?
- Think of a question about a transport system you know well and how data science could help answer it, perhaps with reference to a sketch like that below

#### How much potential is there for cycling across the transport network? {-}

#### How can travel to schools be made safer? {-}

#### How can hospitals encourage visitors to get there safely? {-}

#### Where's the best place to build electric car charging points? {-}

See https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/53.80689/-1.55637 for more ideas

<!-- 2. Work through the transport chapter of Geocomputation with R: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html -->

<!-- See https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/practicals/2-software.md -->


<!-- - In terms of future work in an evolving job market? -->
<!-- - In terms of the kinds of problems you want to solve? -->

<!-- ## Sketching research methods (in groups of 2-4, 30 minutes) -->

<!-- Starting with the 1000 'desire lines' dataset of Leeds, sketch-out some research ideas that cover -->

<!-- 1) Hypotheses: generate two hypotheses that are falsifiable and 2 hypotheses that are not falsifiable -->

<!-- 2) Input data: draw schematic representations of additional datasets that you could use alongside the desire lines dataset, with at least one at each of these levels: -->

<!-- - Zones -->
<!-- - Points -->
<!-- - Routes -->
<!-- - Route networks -->
<!-- - Individual -->

<!-- What temporal and spatial resolution could each one have? -->

<!-- 3) Methods: using a flow diagram (e.g. as shown below) -->

```{r schematic, echo=FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/flow-model/flow-diag2.png")
```

<!-- ## Practical, group computer task (30 minutes) -->

<!-- Create a github account (all). See: https://github.com -->

<!-- Building on the follow code chunk (but with no copy-and-pasting), create a data frame that contains the names, coffee habits and like/dislike of bus travel for everyone in your group (just 1 computer per group): -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- person_name = c( -->
<!--   "robin", -->
<!--   "malcolm", -->
<!--   "richard" -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- n_coffee = c( -->
<!--   5, -->
<!--   1, -->
<!--   0 -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- like_bus_travel = c( -->
<!--   TRUE, -->
<!--   FALSE, -->
<!--   TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- personal_data = data.frame(person_name, n_coffee, like_bus_travel) -->
<!-- personal_data -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- When you are complete, add your code to https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/code-r/01-person-data.R -->

<!-- ## Learning outcomes -->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

<!-- - Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods -->

# R foundations

This section builds on the Reproducible road safety with R homework, to **read and try to complete the exercises in Chapters 1 to 4 of the book Reproducible Road Safety Research with R.**
It assumes that you have recently updated R and RStudio on your computer.
For details on installing packages see here: https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/articles/stats19-training-setup.html

- Create a new R project called 'practical1'
- In it create file called foundations.Rmd
- Type the following


````markdown

This is some text:

```{r}
casualty_type = c("pedestrian", "cyclist", "cat")
casualty_age = seq(from = 20, to = 60, by = 20)
crashes = data.frame(casualty_type, casualty_age)
```
````

- Knit the document by pressing Ctrl+Shift+K or with the 'Knit' button in RStudio
    - Bonus: you can also 'knit' or compile the file with the following command, try it out to generate different file formats, as described in the [package's documentation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html):
    
```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("foundations.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")
browseURL("/tmp/foundations.pdf")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
casualty_type = c("pedestrian", "cyclist", "cat")
casualty_age = seq(from = 20, to = 60, by = 20)
crashes = data.frame(casualty_type, casualty_age)
vehicle_type = c("car", "bus", "tank")
crashes$vehicle_type = vehicle_type
```

We now have a data frame object stored in memory (technically in the global environment) that is used as the basis of the questions.

To get some larger datasets, try the following (from Chapter 8 of RSRR)

```{r}
library(stats19)
ac = get_stats19(year = 2019, type = "collision")
ca = get_stats19(year = 2019, type = "cas")
ve = get_stats19(year = 2019, type = "veh")
```


2.3.1. Use the `$` operator to print the `vehicle_type` column of `crashes`.

    - In R the `$` symbol is used to refer to elemements of a list. So the answer is simply `crashes$vehicle_type`

2.3.2. Subsetting the crashes with the `[,]` syntax

    - Try out different combinations on the dataframe
    
2.3.3. **Bonus**: what is the `class()` of the objects created by each of the previous exercises? 

    - Explore how many R classes you can find
    
Let's go through these  exercises together:

1. Subset the `casualty_age` object using the inequality (`<`) so that only elements less than 50 are returned.
1. Subset the `crashes` data frame so that only tanks are returned using the `==` operator.
1. **Bonus**: assign the age of all tanks to 61.

- Try running the subsetting code on a larger dataset, e.g. the `ac` object created previously

1. Coerce the `vehicle_type` column of `crashes` to the class `character`.
1. Coerce the `crashes` object into a matrix. What happened to the values?
1. **Bonus:** What is the difference between the output of `summary()` on `character` and `factor` variables?

- We'll explore this together

## Bonus: reproduce the contents of Chapter 2 in Python 

# Practical introduction to data science

## Completing Chapters 2-4 in the RRSRR document

- This was your homework but revisit it an ensure you understand every bit and complete it if you haven't already

## Tidyverse

- Work through Chapter 5 starting with the following code:

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # Load the package
```

- Work through chapters 6 and 7 on spatial and temporal data to get R foundations


## Bonus: Analysis of flights data

You need to have a number of packages installed and loaded.
Install the packages by typing in the following commands into RStudio (you do not need to add the comments after the `#` symbol):^[
Note: if you want to install the development version of a package from GitHub, you can do so.
Try, for example, running the following command: `remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/pct")`
]

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
pkgs = c(
  "nycflights13",# data package
  "stats19",     # downloads and formats open stats19 crash data
  "tidyverse"   # a package for user friendly data science
)
remotes::install_cran(pkgs)
remotes::install_github("nowosad/spDataLarge")
```

Load the tidyverse package as follows:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This section will use content from Chapter 5 of the R for Data Science book [@grolemund_data_2016].

- Read [section 5.1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#filter-rows-with-filter) of R for Data Science and write code that reproduces the results in that section in the script `learning-tidyverse.R`

Your script will start with something like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

- Take a random sample of 10,000 flights and assign it to an object with the following line of code:

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights_sample = sample_n(flights, 1e4)
unique(flights$carrier)
```

- Find the unique carriers with the `unique()` function

- Create an object containing flights from United, American, or Delta, and assign it to `f`, as follows:

```{r}
f = filter(flights, grepl(pattern = "UA|AA|DL", x = carrier))
f2 = filter(flights, grepl(pattern = "UA", x = carrier) |
             grepl(pattern = "AA", x = carrier) |
             grepl(pattern = "DL", x = carrier)
           )
f3 = filter(flights, str_detect(carrier, "UA|AA|DL"))
```

- Create plots that visualise the sample flights, using code from Chapter 3 of the same book, starting with the following plot:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance))
```

- Add transparency so it looks like this (hint: use `alpha =` in the `geom_point()` function call):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance), alpha = 0.1)
```

- Add a colour for each carrier, so it looks something like this:

```{r}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance, colour = carrier), alpha = 0.5)
```

- Bonus 1: find the average air time of those flights with a distance of 1000 to 2000 miles

- Bonus 2: use the `lm()` function to find the relationship between flight distance and time, and plot the results (start the plot as follows, why did we use `na.omit()`? hint - find help with `?na.omit()`):

```{r}
f = na.omit(f)
m = lm(air_time ~ distance, data = f)
f$pred = m$fitted.values
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(f) +
  geom_point(aes(air_time, distance, colour = carrier), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(pred, distance))
```

# Homework

1) create a reproducible document 

- Create an Rmarkdown file with the following command:

```r
file.edit("learning-tidyverse.Rmd")
```

- Take a read of the guidance on RMarkdown files online and in the following location (or search online for the 'RMarkdown cheatsheet'):

```
Help > Cheatsheets > RMarkdown
```

- Put the code you generated for `tidyverse.R` into the Rmd file and knit it

- Bonus: create a GitHub repo and publish the results of of your work (hint: putting `output: github_document` may help here!)

2) Work-through the remaining exercises of the first sections in R4DS chapters 3 and 5
  - Write and R script, with comments, to show your working (and prove you've done it!)
  
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mpg
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(hwy, cyl, col = drv ))
library(nycflights13)
names(flights)
?flights
# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
# part 1:
delayed_hour = flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 60)
nrow(delayed_hour) / nrow(flights)
# part 2: calculate length of delay
flight_delays = flights %>% 
  mutate(delay = dep_delay - arr_delay)
summary(flight_delays$delay)

# part 3:
result = flight_delays %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 60 & delay > 30)  
nrow(result)

summary(is.na(flights$arr_delay))

# base R approach
sel_delayed = flights$dep_delay > 60 &
  !is.na(flights$dep_delay)
sel_arrive = flights$arr_delay < 30 &
  !is.na(flights$arr_delay)
class(sel_arrive)
sel_combined = sel_arrive & sel_delayed
sum(sel_combined)
result2 = flights[sel_combined, ]
nrow(result2)
```
  

3) Create an RMarkdown file containing reproducible code outlining what you learned today
