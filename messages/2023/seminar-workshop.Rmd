- Practical work: using RMarkdown to write a coursework topic and technical questions - see https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/ - 15 min

### Option 2: accessing OSM data with pydriosm

Try installing the package and follow some of the online documentation: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11trWfJZ_opp2r4GiksRg19MhFgAsoR3A#scrollTo=eCspbh5wuWWB

```bash
docker run -it ghcr.io/geocompx/docker:mamba /bin/bash
micromamba install pydriosm
micromamba install osm2rail
pip install pydriosm

```

### Option 3: Getting rail data with R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(osmextract)
# ?oe_get
# example from help: "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE oneway == 'yes'"

q = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE railway == 'rail'"
# Try for a small area:
railways_iow = oe_get(place = "isle of wight", query = q, extra_tags = "railway")
nrow(railways_iow)
plot(railways_iow$geometry)
railways_england = oe_get(place = "England", query = q, extra_tags = "railway")
plot(railways_england$geometry)
```


```{python}

```
