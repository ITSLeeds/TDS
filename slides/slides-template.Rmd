# This session in context

   - Introduction to transport data science

-  ## <font color="red"> Software for practical data science</font> 

 - The structure of transport data
 - Data cleaning and subsetting
 - Accessing data from web sources
 - Routing
 - Data visualization
 - Project work
 - Machine learning
 - Professional issues
 
---

## Objectives

From the course [catalogue](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md):

```{r}
# Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic
# Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data
# Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets
# Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
# Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
# Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
```

- Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio 

---

## Learning outcomes

```{r}
# Identify available datasets and access and clean them
# Combine datasets from multiple sources
# Understand what machine learning is, which problems it is appropriate for compared with traditional statistical approaches, and how to implement machine learning techniques
# Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science, and know about setting-up interactive web applications
# Deciding when to use local computing power vs cloud services
```

- Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods

# Citations

Can be added as follows:
`r Citep(my_bib, "boeing_osmnx:_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

---

# remark.js

You can see an introduction of remark.js from [its homepage](https://remarkjs.com). You should read the [remark.js Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) at least once to know how to

- create a new slide (Markdown syntax<sup>*</sup> and slide properties);

- format a slide (e.g. text alignment);

- configure the slideshow;

- and use the presentation (keyboard shortcuts).

It is important to be familiar with remark.js before you can understand the options in **xaringan**.

.footnote[[*] It is different with Pandoc's Markdown! It is limited but should be enough for presentation purposes. Come on... You do not need a slide for the Table of Contents! Well, the Markdown support in remark.js [may be improved](https://github.com/gnab/remark/issues/142) in the future.]

---

# xaringan

Provides an R Markdown output format `xaringan::moon_reader` as a wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata, e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "A Cool Presentation"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader
    yolo: true
    nature:
      autoplay: 30000
---
```

See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for all possible options that you can use.

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;
]

.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]
