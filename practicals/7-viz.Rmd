## Basics of data visualisation

Data visualisation is a powerful way to help understand and communicate insights about the real world contained in data.

Take this dataset:

```{r}
crashes_gb = stats19::get_stats19(year = 2018, type = "accident")
crashes_gb
```

Without some kind of analysis, it is hard to understand the meaning of the data.
Descriptive statistics can help, e.g. on the percentage of different crashes that happened by speed limit:

```{r}
count_table = table(crashes_gb$speed_limit, crashes_gb$accident_severity)
count_table
count_table_proportions = count_table / rowSums(count_table)
round(count_table_proportions * 100, 1)
```

As expected, crashes that happened on roads with a higher speed limit have a higher fatality rate.
This can be visualised in a more appealing and intuitive way, e.g. as follows:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(crashes_gb) + geom_bar(aes(accident_severity)) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(crashes_gb, aes(speed_limit)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = accident_severity), position = "fill")
```

**Exercise**: Read the documentation that appears when you run this line of code:

```
?facet_grid
```

Create a facetted plot with a different facet for each speed limit.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(crashes_gb) + geom_bar(aes(accident_severity)) +
  facet_grid(~ speed_limit)
```

## Exercises: group

1. Create a map showing the number of people walking in the `stplanr` dataset `flowlines_sf` using:
-base graphics (hint: use `plot()`) and
-**tmap** (hint: use `tm_shape(flowlines_sf) + ...`, `palette = "viridis"` and other options shown in `tmaptools::palette_explorer()` give different colourschemes).
    - Name two advantages of each approach
    - Bonus: What three other mapping packages could be used to show the same data?
    

## Result: base graphics
    
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.show='hold', message=FALSE}
library(stplanr)
lwd = flowlines_sf$All / mean(flowlines_sf$All) * 3
plot(flowlines_sf["Taxi"], lwd = lwd)

```

## Result: tmap

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(flowlines_sf) +
  tm_lines(col = "Taxi", lwd = "All", scale = 9, palette = "viridis")
```



## Exercises: Individual

- Based on the `routes_fast_sf` data in the `stplanr` package, identify roads where investment in cycling is likely to be effective.

Starting point:

```{r}
nrow(flowlines_sf)
nrow(routes_fast_sf)
# routes_fast_sf = dplyr::inner_join(routes_fast_sf, flow)
routes_fast_sf = cbind(routes_fast_sf, flowlines_sf)
```



## sf results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(routes_fast_sf["Bicycle"], lwd = routes_fast_sf$All / 50)
```



## tmap 'view mode' results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(routes_fast_sf) +
  tm_lines(col = "Bicycle", lwd = "All", scale = 9, palette = "RdYlBu")
```



## Exercises bonus (optional)

- Work through the PCT training vignette at: https://itsleeds.github.io/pct/articles/pct_training.html
- Using data in the `pct` github package, estimate cycling potential in a city of your choice in the UK, and show the results.


## Homework

- To improve you R skills, work through the stats19 tutorial here: https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/articles/stats19-training.html
- Work on your portfolios, adding a new visualisation of the data you will use
