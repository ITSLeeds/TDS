```{r, include=FALSE}
# setup
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# print pdf
pagedown::chrome_print("practicals/6-routing.md")
pagedown::chrome_print("practicals/6-routing.html")
browseURL("practicals/6-routing.pdf")

piggyback::pb_download_url("practicals/6-routing.pdf")
```

## Setting Up

If you have not done the [homework](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/practicals/6-routing-homework.md), do that first.

The packages we will be using are:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)         # Spatial data functions
library(lwgeom) 
library(tidyverse)  # General data manipulation
library(stplanr)    # General transport data functions
library(dodgr)      # Local routing and network analysis
library(opentripplanner) # Connect to and use OpenTripPlanner
library(tmap)       # Make maps
library(osmextract) # Download and import OpenStreetMap data
tmap_mode("plot")
```

## Using OpenTripPlanner to get routes

We have setup the Multi-modal routing service OpenTripPlanner for West Yorkshire. Try the link on Minerva. 

```{r minerva, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Minerva Link"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/practicals/minerva_link.JPG?raw=true")
```

You should see something like this:

```{r otpgui, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="OTP Web GUI"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/practicals/otp_screenshot.png?raw=true")
```

**Exercise**

1. Play with the web interface, finding different types of routes. What strengths/limitations can you find?

Notice that the URL is in the form of `ip:port` note these down as you will use them below.

### Connecting to OpenTripPlanner

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
piggyback::pb_upload("otp_TDS.zip")
piggyback::pb_download_url("otp_TDS.zip")
# https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.20.1/otp_TDS.zip
```


```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash', echo=FALSE}
# Install Java 8:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

# java â€“Xmx10000M -d64 -jar "D:/OneDrive - University of Leeds/Data/opentripplanner/otp-1.5.0-shaded.jar" --router west-yorkshire --graphs "D:/OneDrive - University of Leeds/Data/opentripplanner/graphs" --server --port 8080 --securePort 8081
sudo update-alternatives --config java
# java --version
java -version
java
ls otp_TDS
sudo ufw allow 8080
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -Xmx10000M -d64 -jar "otp_TDS/otp-1.5.0-shaded.jar" --router west-yorkshire --graphs "otp_TDS/graphs" --server --port 8080 --securePort 8081
# ip = "81.2052.102.153:154" 
```

To allow R to connect to the OpenTripPlanner server, we will use the `opentripplanner` package and the function `otp_connect`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ip = "xx.xxx.xxx.xxx" # See the link on Minerva for correct value
port = 0000           # See the link on Minerva for correct value
otpcon = otp_connect(hostname = ip, 
                     port = port,
                     router = "west-yorkshire")
```

If you have connected successfully, then you should get a message "Router exists."

Create a test route. Notice than in the web UI the coordiante are `Lat/Lng` but R uses `Lng/Lat`

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
routes_test = otp_plan(otpcon = otpcon,
                            fromPlace = c(-1.55555, 53.81005), #Lng/Lat
                            toPlace = c(-1.54710, 53.79519),
                            mode = "WALK") 
```
You can use multiple modes and combinations try:

* `mode = "WALK"`
* `mode = c("WALK","TRANSIT")`
* `mode = c("BICYCLE","TRANSIT")`
* `mode = "CAR"`
* `mode = c("CAR_PARK","TRANSIT")`


To get some more routes, we will start by importing some data. The `NTEM_flow.geojson` dataset the contains the top desire lines in West Yorkshire. It was produced from a transport model called the [National Trip End Model](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/11bc7aaf-ddf6-4133-a91d-84e6f20a663e/national-trip-end-model-ntem) and research from the [University of Leeds](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/NTEM2OD).


```{r, message=FALSE}
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/22/NTEM_flow.geojson"
desire_lines = read_sf(u)
head(desire_lines)
```

We will also download the points that represent the possible start and end point of trips in the model

```{r, message=FALSE}
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/22/NTEM_cents.geojson"
centroids = read_sf(u)
head(centroids)
```


**Exercise** 

2. Plot the `desire_lines` and `centroids` objects using the `tmap` to show the number of travellers on each desire_line and the locations of all centroids.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
tmap_mode("plot") #Change to view for interactive map
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(lwd = "all", col = "all", scale = 4, palette = "-viridis") +
  tm_shape(centroids) +
  tm_dots(col = "red")
```

3. Produce some different maps for each mode of travel in the `desire_lines` dataset. How do the numbers of travellers change for walking, driving, and train travel? See example plot below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
tmap_mode("plot") # Change to view for interactive map
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(lwd = "rail", col = "rail", scale = 4, palette = "-viridis", style = "jenks")
```


This dataset has desire lines, but most routing packages need start and endpoints, so we will extract the start and endpoints using the package `lwgeom`

**Exercise**

4. Produce a data frame called `desire_top` which contains the top three `desire_lines` for all travellers. Hint `?top_n`

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
desire_top = desire_lines %>% 
  top_n(n = 3, wt = all)
```

5. We need to extract start and end point from those desire lines. We would also like to give each place an ID value

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Extract the start and end points
fromPlace <- lwgeom::st_startpoint(desire_top)
toPlace <- lwgeom::st_endpoint(desire_top)

# This returns just the geometry
# So make it into an sf data.frame with the ID values from desire_top

fromPlace <- st_sf(data.frame(id = desire_top$from, geometry = fromPlace))
toPlace <- st_sf(data.frame(id = desire_top$to, geometry = toPlace))

```


6. Create a new object called `routes_drive_top`, with driving routes between the OD pairs represented in the `desire_top` object. 

Calculate routes for the first three desire lines with the following command:

```{r, message=FALSE,  eval=FALSE}
routes_drive_top = otp_plan(otpcon = otpcon,
                            fromPlace = fromPlace,
                            toPlace = toPlace,
                            fromID = fromPlace$id,
                            toID = toPlace$id,
                            mode = "CAR")
```

```{r, message=FALSE,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
routes_drive_top = readRDS("routes_drive_top.Rds")
```


7. Plot `routes_drive_top` using the `tmap` package mode. You should see something like the image below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

```{r}
tm_shape(routes_drive_top) + tm_lines()
```

We can also get Isochrones from OTP.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
isochrone = otp_isochrone(otpcon, 
                          fromPlace = c(-1.558655, 53.807870), 
                          mode = c("BICYCLE","TRANSIT"),
                          maxWalkDistance = 3000)
isochrone$time = isochrone$time / 60
tm_shape(isochrone) +
  tm_fill("time", alpha = 0.6)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
isochrone = readRDS("isochrone.Rds")
isochrone$time = isochrone$time / 60
tm_shape(isochrone) +
  tm_fill("time", alpha = 0.6)
```


To save you time and to prevent overloading the server, we have pre-generated some extra routes. Download these routes and load them into R.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
routes_drive = route(l = desire_lines, route_fun = otp_plan, otpcon = otpcon, mode = "CAR")
# fromPlace = centroids[match(desire_lines$from, centroids$Zone_Code),]
# toPlace = centroids[match(desire_lines$to, centroids$Zone_Code),]
# routes_drive = otp_plan(otpcon = otpcon,
#                             fromPlace = fromPlace,
#                             toPlace = toPlace,
#                             fromID = fromPlace$Zone_Code,
#                             toID = toPlace$Zone_Code,
#                             mode = "CAR",
#                             ncores = 20)

sf::write_sf(routes_drive, "routes_drive.geojson", delete_dsn = TRUE)
piggyback::pb_upload("routes_drive.geojson")

date_time = lubridate::ymd_hms("2022-01-25 09:00:00") 
routes_transit = route(
  l = desire_lines, route_fun = otp_plan, otpcon = otpcon,
  mode = c("WALK","TRANSIT"), date_time = date_time, maxWalkDist = 2000
  )

# routes_transit = otp_plan(otpcon = otpcon,
#                             fromPlace = fromPlace,
#                             toPlace = toPlace,
#                             fromID = fromPlace$Zone_Code,
#                             toID = toPlace$Zone_Code,
#                             mode = c("WALK","TRANSIT"),
#                             date_time = date_time,
#                             ncores = 20,
#                             maxWalkDistance = 2000)
summary(st_is_valid(routes_transit))
routes_transit = st_make_valid(routes_transit)
sf::write_sf(routes_transit, "routes_transit.geojson", delete_dsn = TRUE)
piggyback::pb_upload("routes_transit.geojson")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/22/routes_drive.geojson"
routes_drive = read_sf(u)
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/22/routes_transit.geojson"
routes_transit = read_sf(u)
```

We will now join the number of drivers onto the driving routes.

**Exercise**

8. Create a dataset called `n_driver` from `desire_lines` which only have the columns `from` `to` and `drive`. Hint ?dplyr::select  and ?sf::st_drop_geometry


```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
n_driver = desire_lines %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  select(from, to, drive)
```

9. Join the `n_driver` data onto the `routes_drive` data by linking `fromPlace = from` and `toPlace = to`. Hint ?dplyr::left_join.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
routes_drive = left_join(routes_drive, n_driver, by = c("fromPlace" = "from","toPlace" = "to"))
```

10. Plot the routes showing the number of drivers on each route.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(routes_drive) +
  tm_lines(col = "drive", lwd = 2, palette = "-viridis")
```



## Route Networks (also called flow maps)

The map above shows some useful information about where people drive. But it has a problem. When many routes overlap it hides some of the drivers. What would be more useful would be to add those drivers together so we can see the total number of drivers on each road. This is what a route network does.

We can produce a route network map using `stplanr::overline`.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
rnet_drive = overline(routes_drive, "drive")
```

**Exercise**

10. Make a route network for driving and plot it using the `tmap` package. How is is different from just plotting the routes?

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(rnet_drive) +
  tm_lines(lwd = 2, col = "drive", style = "jenks", palette = "-viridis")
```

## Line Merging

Notice that `routes_transit` has returned separate rows for each mode (WALK, RAIL, BUS). Notice the `route_option` column shows that some routes have multiple options.

Let's suppose you want a single line for each route.

**Exercise**

11. Filter the `routes_transit` to contain only one route option per origin-destination pair and only the columns `fromPlace` `toPlace` `distance` `geometry`


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
routes_transit = routes_transit %>%
  filter(route_option == 1) %>%
  select(fromPlace, toPlace, distance)
```

Now We will group the separate parts of the routes together.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
routes_transit_group = routes_transit %>%
  dplyr::group_by(fromPlace, toPlace) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(distance = sum(distance))
```

We now have a single row, but instead of a `LINESTRING`, we now have a mix of `MULTILINESTRING` and `LINESTRING`, we can convert to a `LINESTRING` by using `st_line_merge()`. Note how the different columns where summarised.

First, we must separate out the `MULTILINESTRING` and `LINESTRING`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
routes_transit_group_ml = routes_transit_group[st_geometry_type(routes_transit_group) == "MULTILINESTRING", ]
routes_transit_group = routes_transit_group[st_geometry_type(routes_transit_group) != "MULTILINESTRING", ]
routes_transit_group_ml = st_line_merge(routes_transit_group_ml)
routes_transit_group = rbind(routes_transit_group, routes_transit_group_ml)
```

**Exercise**

12. Plot the transit routes, what do you notice about them?

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(routes_transit_group) +
  tm_lines(lwd = 2, col = "black", palette = "-viridis")
```

**Bonus Exercise**: 

13. Redo exercise 16 but make sure you always select the fastest option. You may need to re-download the `routes_transit` data.

## Network Analysis (dodgr)

**Note** Some people have have problems running dodgr on Windows, if you do follow these [instructions](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/practicals/dodgr-install.md).

We will now analyse the road network using `dodgr`. Network analysis can take a very long time on large areas. So we will use the example of the [Isle of Wight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight), which is ideal for transport studies as it is small, but has a full transport system including a railway and the last commercial hovercraft service in the world.

First we need to download the roads network from the OpenStreetMap using `osmextract::oe_get`. We will removed most of the paths and other features and just focus on the main roads. Then use `dodgr::weight_streetnet` to produce a graph of the road network.

```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Download data from OpenSteetMap
roads = oe_get("Isle of Wight", extra_tags = c("maxspeed","oneway"))

# Remove non-road data
roads = roads[!is.na(roads$highway),]

# Only get some road types see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway
road_types = c("primary","primary_link",
               "secondary","secondary_link",
               "tertiary", "tertiary_link",
               "residential","unclassified")
roads = roads[roads$highway %in% road_types, ]

# Build a graph
graph = weight_streetnet(roads)
```


We will find the betweenness centrality of the Isle of Wight road network. This can take a long time, so first lets check how long it will take. 

```{r, message=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
estimate_centrality_time(graph)
centrality = dodgr_centrality(graph)
```

We can convert a `dodgr` graph back into a sf data frame for plotting using `dodgr::dodgr_to_sf`

```{r, message=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
clear_dodgr_cache()
centrality_sf = dodgr_to_sf(centrality)
```

**Exercise**

14. Plot the centrality of the Isle of Wight road network. What can centrality tell you about a road network?

```{r, message=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(centrality_sf) +
  tm_lines("centrality",
           lwd = 3,
           n = 8,
           style = "fisher",
           palette = "-viridis")

```

15. Use `dodgr::dodgr_contract_graph` before calculating centrality, how does this affect the computation time and the results?

**Bonus Exercises**

16. Work though the OpenTripPlanner vignettes [Getting Started](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/articles/opentripplanner.html) and [Advanced Features](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/articles/advanced_features.html) to run your own local trip planner for the Isle of Wight.

**Note** To use OpenTripPlanner on your own computer requires Java 8. See the [Prerequisites](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/articles/prerequisites.html) for more details. If you can't install Java 8 try some of the examples in the vignettes but modify them for West Yorkshire.

17. Read the `dodgr` [vignettes](https://atfutures.github.io/dodgr/articles/index.html)
