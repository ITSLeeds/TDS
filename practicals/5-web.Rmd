## Review of homework exercise: demo with RMarkdown then individual Q&A

We will be using these packages in this practical:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(stats19)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Accessing crowd-sourced data from OSM

- Navigate to https://overpass-turbo.eu/ and play with the interface to see what data is available from OpenStreetMap. Download data on highway=cycleway for Leeds from https://overpass-turbo.eu/

- Load the data in R and plot it with your favourite plotting package (e.g. `sf`, `mapview` or `tmap`)

- Bonus: now try to get the same data using the **osmdata** package

## Get official data with stats19

- Take a read of the stats19 README page and at least one of the articles on it here: https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/
- Install and load the stats19 package as with one of the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("stats19") # the stable version
# remotes::install_github("ropensci/stats19") # the most recent 'development' version
```

- Show crashes involving pedestrians in Manchester by reproducing the following lines of code:

```{r}
library(sf)
library(stats19)
library(tidyverse)
crashes_2018 = get_stats19(year = 2018)
crashes_2018_sf = format_sf(crashes_2018)
crashes_manchester = crashes_2018_sf %>% filter(local_authority_district == "Manchester")
plot(crashes_manchester["accident_severity"])
casualties_2018 = get_stats19(year = 2018, type = "cas")
crashes_manchester = inner_join(crashes_manchester, casualties_2018)
pedestrian_casualties = crashes_manchester %>% filter(casualty_type == "Pedestrian")
plot(pedestrian_casualties["accident_severity"])
```

- Use the tmap package to create an interactive map of pedestrian casualties in Manchester, starting with the following commands (hint, use `tmaptools::palette_explorer()` and the argument `palette = "Reds"` in the function `tm_dots()`, for example, to change the default colour palette):

```{r}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("plot")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(pedestrian_casualties) +
  tm_dots("accident_severity", palette = "RdYlBu")
```

- Based on the documentation at https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/:
  
  - Download data on road crashes in Great Britain in 2018
  - Filter crashes that happened in Leeds
  
- Bonus: make a map of pedestrian casualties in Leeds that shows the speed limit where pedestrians were hit. Explore the results in an interactive map. Where do you think the speed limit should be reduced based on this data?

The result should look something like this:

```{r}
crashes_leeds = crashes_2018_sf %>% filter(local_authority_district == "Leeds")
crashes_leeds = inner_join(crashes_leeds, casualties_2018)
pedestrian_casualties = crashes_leeds %>% filter(casualty_type == "Pedestrian")
tm_shape(pedestrian_casualties) +
  tm_dots("speed_limit")
```

- Bonus: what is the relationship between crash severity and the speed limit?

- Bonus: download and visualise the Leeds Bradford Cycle Superhighway data with these commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(osmdata)
data_osm = opq("leeds uk") %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "Cycle Superhighway 1") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
saveRDS(data_osm, "data_osm_cycle_superhighway.Rds")
piggyback::pb_upload("data_osm_cycle_superhighway.Rds")
piggyback::pb_download_url("data_osm_cycle_superhighway.Rds")
```


```{r}
# if the previous command fails, try:
data_osm = readRDS(url("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.20.1/data_osm_cycle_superhighway.Rds"))
cycleway_100m_buffer = stplanr::geo_buffer(data_osm$osm_lines, dist = 100)
crashes_leeds_lon_lat = crashes_leeds %>% st_transform(4326)
crashes_near_cycle_superhighway = crashes_leeds_lon_lat[cycleway_100m_buffer, ]
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(data_osm$osm_lines) + tm_lines() +
  tm_shape(crashes_near_cycle_superhighway) + tm_dots("casualty_type")
```

  - Filter crashes that happened within a 500 m buffer of the cycle infrastructure
  - Do cyclists seem safer on the cycle superhighway?
  - Bonus: pull down origin-destination data with the `pct` package hosted at: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct

## Get travel to work data with the PCT

Use the `pct` package's inbuilt help to find out how to get data for West Yorkshire.
Hint: the code below gets zones for Leeds:

```{r getzones}
library(pct)
head(pct::pct_regions)
# see all regions with View(pct_regions)
zones = get_pct_zones(region = "west-yorkshire")
zones_leeds = zones %>% 
  filter(lad_name == "Leeds")
zones_leeds %>% 
  select(bicycle:taxi_other) %>% 
  plot()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?get_pct_routes_fast
```

Bonus (if you have time and a decent computer): download and import the 'car.zip' data from https://github.com/ITSLeeds/NTEM2OD/releases

## Getting data from the web

Read through Section [8.2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html#retrieving-data) and 8.3 of Geocomputation with R. 

Complete Excersises 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the chapter

## Bonus 1: osmextract

Take a read of the documentation for the [`osmextract`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract/index.html) package.

Reproduce the examples

Get all supermarkets in OSM for West Yorkshire

Identify all cycleways in West Yorkshire and, using the stats19 data you have already downloaded, identify all crashes that happened near them.

## Bonus 2: Getting data from statistics.gov.uk 

Identify a region and zonal units of interest from http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/

- Read them into R as an `sf` object
- Join-on data from a non-geographic object

- Add a data access section to your in progress portfolio

## Bonus 3: find another geographic or transport dataset hosted online and write code to download it

- Share the code on Teams or in a GitHub issue: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/issues

## Some suggested links


### Boundary data 
The list below provides links to some key data sources that may be of use and interest, starting with the most universal and easy to use, and ending in rather specific datasets.
-	UK geoportal, providing geographic data at many levels: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk
-	Other national geoportals exist, such as this: http://www.geoportal.org/


### UK specific resources
Students can register with Edina Digimap. It is a service which will allow you to download UK topographic map data.
https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/webhelp/digimapsupport/about.htm#access/access_to_digimap.htm
UK census data can be accessed from several places including: https://census.edina.ac.uk/bds.html https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011
https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011

The UK data service hosts a wide variety of spatial and survey data sets.  An example is this recently released land use data
https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/854240/
The Placed-Based Carbon Calculator has transport data about the UK with free downloads on the Data page.
https://www.carbon.place

The University of Leeds is a partner in the Consumer Data Research Centre.  Examples of data available include 
Access to Healthy Assets & Hazards (AHAH)
https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/access-healthy-assets-hazards-ahah
And access to online grocery deliveries 
https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/e-food-deserts/
Some CDRC datasets are openly available and others are accessible to students and researchers.  You can register with your university of Leeds account


### International resources
The United nations have a number of access points for spatial data.  For example this for data relating to sustainable development goals: 
https://unstats-undesa.opendata.arcgis.com/
European Union data sets are available here
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata

There are other data sources and links to data.  Here are some examples.  
http://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/ Note this has a listing of several transport data sources http://www.gadm.org/ boundary datasets for administrative areas around the world.
https://www.gislounge.com/world-gis-data/ links to further resources 
https://library.stanford.edu/research/stanford-geospatial-center/data Stanford University directory of data sources http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata available datasets by country.
(availability of these resources may change)

### Some sources of transport data
Some government agencies publish data.  Sometimes these are in spatial formats such as shapefiles.  In other cases they are spreadsheets with zone identifiers which can be joined to spatial data.  
•	UK government transport data: https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/publisher/department-for-transport

This is an example of a site based in the USA. Most of the data is for the USA, but there are some international data sets.  Some sites such as this require you to join or register to use the data.
